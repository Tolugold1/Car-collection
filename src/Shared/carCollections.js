    details: 'The G82-codenamed M4 has a new engine, and while it may not be a free-breathing V8, it does produce significantly more power and more accessible torque than even the hardcore BMW M4 GTS of 2015 had.The car also gets a drivetrain unlike that of any compact M car before it. You can have a rear-wheel-drive, manual gearbox-equipped M4 in some markets (but the UK isn\'t one of them). Otherwise, you can have one with an eight-speed automatic gearbox or even, in a significant break from this car\'s acknowledged technical template, with four-wheel drive, with xDrive M3s and M4s due to join rear-driven ones here in the UK later this year. The M4\'s mechanical specification is far easier to take to heart. The car\'s 3.0-litre, twin-turbocharged S58 straight six engine is new, and it\'s a force to be reckoned with. It makes 503bhp from 5600-7200rpm and 479lb ft between 2750rpm and 5500rpm, all of which was deployed in our test car\'s case to the rear wheels via an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential - although, as we\'ve already mentioned, other driveline configurations are now available.'

Rolls-Royce also says the Boat Tail has a colour blend of “oyster and soft rose”, with a pearlescent finish that changes under different light conditions. The bonnet, finished in a "cognac colour", has been designed specifically for the model and features bronze and aluminium mica flakes, as well as a crystalised and ice matt coating. The sills, meanwhile, are coloured rose gold. A wooden deck has been added to the rear of the car, concealing a bespoke “hosting suite”, with a unique “butterfly design” dining set and an umbrella. Walnut-coloured leather appears throughout the interior, which has rose gold accents and a walnut veneer. Rolls-Royce says the leather materials on the dashboard, armrests, centre console and seats employ a pearlescent finish.'

    name: 'Telluride LX',
    details: 'Looking instantly recognizable, the range-topping crossover receives a lightly revised grille with all-new Kia badging. Additional changes are limited, but Kia\'s new logo can also be found on the liftgate. Moving into the cabin, all trims gain a Navigation-Based Smart Cruise Control-Curve system. It automatically slows down the vehicle as it approaches a bend in the road. Furthermore, the entry-level LX and S trims gain additional standard equipment including an automatic climate control system, highway driving assist and a 10.25-inch infotainment system with GPS navigation. The latter replaces the previous 8-inch display, which used to come standard on the base model. Unfortunately, the updates are accompanied by price increases as the 2022 Telluride LX starts at $32,790. That\'s $600 more than last year\'s model, but it\'s not bad considering the additional equipment.'
